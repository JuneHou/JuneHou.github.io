abstract: "Explainable AI (XAI) techniques are necessary to help clinicians make sense of AI predictions and integrate predictions into their decision-making workflow. In this work, we conduct a survey study to understand clinician preference among different XAI techniques when they are used to interpret model predictions over text-based EHR data. We implement four XAI techniques (LIME, Attention-based span highlights, exemplar patient retrieval, and free-text rationales generated by LLMs) on an outcome prediction model that uses ICU admission notes to predict a patientâ€™s likelihood of experiencing in-hospital mortality. Using these XAI implementations, we design and conduct a survey study of 32 practicing clinicians, collecting their feedback and preferences on the four techniques. We synthesize our findings into a set of recommendations describing when each of the XAI techniques may be more appropriate, their potential limitations, as well as recommendations for improvement."
